          Guts, known as the Black Swordsman, seeks sanctuary from the demonic
          forces attracted to him and his woman because of a demonic mark on

          unholy sacrifice. Aided only by his titanic strength gained from a
          harsh childhood lived with mercenaries, a gigantic sword, and an iron
          prosthetic left hand, Guts must struggle against his bleak destiny,
          all the while fighting with a rage that might strip him of his

          As a child, Thorfinn sat at the feet of the great Leif Ericson and
          thrilled to wild tales of a land far to the west. But his youthful
          fantasies were shattered by a mercenary raid. Raised by the Vikings
          who murdered his family, Thorfinn became a terrifying warrior, forever
          seeking to kill the band's leader, Askeladd, and avenge his father.
          Sustaining Thorfinn through his ordeal are his pride in his family and
          his dreams of a fertile westward land, a land without war or slaveryâ€¦
          the land Leif called Vinland.
